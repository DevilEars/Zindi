# Uber Movement SANRAL Cape Town Challenge
Note that I have skipped all the [data files](https://zindi.africa/competitions/uber-movement-sanral-cape-town-challenge/data), since I do not wish to clog my git repo with all kinds of data files.

## Starter code
This code is initially based on the [starter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HjJhghj2b5JJnOFNTcojLfAicDf5QWWK#scrollTo=F7CulRNdygp_&forceEdit=true&sandboxMode=true) from the Zindi forums.
