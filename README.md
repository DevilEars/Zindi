# Zindi
My source code for [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/) competitions.

## My Competition Entries
These are in chronological order. Like Facebook's feed should be.
1. [Uber Movement SANRAL Cape Town Challenge](https://github.com/DevilEars/Zindi/tree/master/Uber%20Movement%20SANRAL%20Cape%20Town%20Challenge). I managed to rank number 82.
1. [Fowl Escapades](). This is still a work in progress.

## Future prospects
1. I would like to display these notebooks more properly, perhaps via Google's Colab framework.
